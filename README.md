# Synthesys+ Task 4.3 International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)

This repository is to help in deploying [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) in natural history collections as part of the [Synthesys+](http://www.synthesys.info/home.html) project funded by the European Commission. It consists of this document, which sets out recommendations for how to implement IIIF in concert with CETAF stable identifiers, plus some example files.

When a CETAF stable identifier links to a specimen record that is accompanied by a high-resolution image (or images) we want to be able to view that image in a way that is independent of the hosting institution and the technologies they use. This will enable applications to be built that can browse and combine specimen images across multiple institutions in real time, creating a truly virtual collection from the userâ€™s perspective. IIIF is a set of API specifications used widely in the libraries and archives community for this purpose. It enables the combining of multiple views of single objects or building composite views of objects from images stored in different locations.

Synthesys+ started on 1st February 2019. Task 4.3 runs until January 2021.

There are three subtasks to Task 4.3

1. __Exemplar IIIF implementations__ involves a target of ten institutions implementing IIIF on their image servers.
1. __Integration of CETAF Identifiers into IIIF browsing__ examines the how we smoothly link between CETAF URIs and IIIF manifests to give a smooth user experience.
1. __Growing the network__ looks at how we spread the word to other collections beyond the project

__This document is working document. It will become more stable as time passes and as implementations are built based on what is written here.__ Issues & suggestions please contact the task leader [Roger Hyam](mailto:r.hyam@rbge.org.uk) or if you want to add significant material issue a pull request.

## Initial implementations 

Subtask 4.3.1 recognises that it is important to get example implementations running as quickly as possible to validate our ideas and inspire wider adoption. This is a list of institutions who aim to complete their implementations by 2021 and their current status. The order starts as arbitrary but will be updated to level of implementation. If your institution is missing or shouldn't be listed [please let me know](mailto:r.hyam@rbge.org.uk).

## Outline of proposed mechanism

Further details are given in sections below.

1. Institutions must implement CETAF Stable Identifiers for their specimens at atleast level 2 - with a 303 redirect to RDF metadata about the specimen. This is described in the [CETAF URI Tester documentation](http://herbal.rbge.info/md.php?q=documentation).
1. Institutions must implement IIIF [Image and Presentation APIs version 3](https://iiif.io/api/) or higher. (Version 3 of the API is still in Alpha but more or less stable and is expected to be fully released in 2019.)
1. RDF returned for specimens should contain a link to a IIIF Manifest file for the image for that specimen.
1. The IIIF Manifest file should contain a link to the CETAF URI for the specimen.
1. It is recommended the IIIF Manifest contains some of the key Darwin Core metadata fields as name-value pairs for labels.
1. It is recommended institutions display a IIIF logo on their website next to the specimen.
